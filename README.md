### **Phase 2: Push to GitHub (The "Fresh Start" Method)**

Since you had errors before, we are going to reset your git connection to ensure it works.

**1. Open your VS Code Terminal (`Ctrl + ~`)**

**2. Initialize Git (If you haven't already)**
```bash
git init


3. Add all your files

git add .


4. Commit your changes

git commit -m "Final V1 Build"


5. Create the Repository on GitHub

Go to github.com/new.

Repository name: milton-hq

Visibility: Public (so Vercel can see it easily) or Private (up to you).

Do NOT check "Add a README" (we already made one).

Click Create repository.

6. Connect and Push (The Important Part)
Copy these commands one by one and paste them into your terminal.

Replace your-username with your actual GitHub username.

git branch -M main
git remote remove origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/milton-hq.git
git push -u origin main
